Exercise 1: Configuring a Basic Spring Application
Scenario: 
Your company is developing a web application for managing a library. You need to use the Spring Framework to handle the backend operations.
Steps:
    1. Set Up a Spring Project:
        ◦ Create a Maven project named LibraryManagement.
        ◦ Add Spring Core dependencies in the pom.xml file.
    2. Configure the Application Context:
        ◦ Create an XML configuration file named applicationContext.xml in the src/main/resources directory.
        ◦ Define beans for BookService and BookRepository in the XML file.
    3. Define Service and Repository Classes:
        ◦ Create a package com.library.service and add a class BookService.
        ◦ Create a package com.library.repository and add a class BookRepository.
    4. Run the Application:
        ◦ Create a main class to load the Spring context and test the configuration.
Exercise 2: Implementing Dependency Injection
Scenario: 
In the library management application, you need to manage the dependencies between the BookService and BookRepository classes using Spring's IoC and DI.
Steps:
    1. Modify the XML Configuration:
        ◦ Update applicationContext.xml to wire BookRepository into BookService.
    2. Update the BookService Class:
        ◦ Ensure that BookService class has a setter method for BookRepository.
    3. Test the Configuration:
        ◦ Run the LibraryManagementApplication main class to verify the dependency injection.



Exercise 3: Implementing Logging with Spring AOP
Scenario: 
The library management application requires logging capabilities to track method execution times.
Steps:
    1. Add Spring AOP Dependency:
        ◦ Update pom.xml to include Spring AOP dependency.
    2. Create an Aspect for Logging:
        ◦ Create a package com.library.aspect and add a class LoggingAspect with a method to log execution times.
    3. Enable AspectJ Support:
        ◦ Update applicationContext.xml to enable AspectJ support and register the aspect.
    4. Test the Aspect:
        ◦ Run the LibraryManagementApplication main class and observe the console for log messages indicating method execution times.
Exercise 4: Creating and Configuring a Maven Project
Scenario: 
You need to set up a new Maven project for the library management application and add Spring dependencies.
Steps:
    1. Create a New Maven Project:
        ◦ Create a new Maven project named LibraryManagement.
    2. Add Spring Dependencies in pom.xml:
        ◦ Include dependencies for Spring Context, Spring AOP, and Spring WebMVC.
    3. Configure Maven Plugins:
        ◦ Configure the Maven Compiler Plugin for Java version 1.8 in the pom.xml file.




Exercise 5: Configuring the Spring IoC Container
Scenario: 
The library management application requires a central configuration for beans and dependencies.
Steps:
    1. Create Spring Configuration File:
        ◦ Create an XML configuration file named applicationContext.xml in the src/main/resources directory.
        ◦ Define beans for BookService and BookRepository in the XML file.
    2. Update the BookService Class:
        ◦ Ensure that the BookService class has a setter method for BookRepository.
    3. Run the Application:
        ◦ Create a main class to load the Spring context and test the configuration.
 
Exercise 6: Configuring Beans with Annotations
Scenario: 
You need to simplify the configuration of beans in the library management application using annotations.
Steps:
    1. Enable Component Scanning:
        ◦ Update applicationContext.xml to include component scanning for the com.library package.
    2. Annotate Classes:
        ◦ Use @Service annotation for the BookService class.
        ◦ Use @Repository annotation for the BookRepository class.
    3. Test the Configuration:
        ◦ Run the LibraryManagementApplication main class to verify the annotation-based configuration.



Exercise 7: Implementing Constructor and Setter Injection
Scenario: 
The library management application requires both constructor and setter injection for better control over bean initialization.
Steps:
    1. Configure Constructor Injection:
        ◦ Update applicationContext.xml to configure constructor injection for BookService.
    2. Configure Setter Injection:
        ◦ Ensure that the BookService class has a setter method for BookRepository and configure it in applicationContext.xml.
    3. Test the Injection:
        ◦ Run the LibraryManagementApplication main class to verify both constructor and setter injection.
Exercise 8: Implementing Basic AOP with Spring
Scenario: 
The library management application requires basic AOP functionality to separate cross-cutting concerns like logging and transaction management.
Steps:
    1. Define an Aspect:
        ◦ Create a package com.library.aspect and add a class LoggingAspect.
    2. Create Advice Methods:
        ◦ Define advice methods in LoggingAspect for logging before and after method execution.
    3. Configure the Aspect:
        ◦ Update applicationContext.xml to register the aspect and enable AspectJ auto-proxying.
    4. Test the Aspect:
        ◦ Run the LibraryManagementApplication main class to verify the AOP functionality.




Exercise 9: Creating a Spring Boot Application
Scenario: 
You need to create a Spring Boot application for the library management system to simplify configuration and deployment.
Steps:
    1. Create a Spring Boot Project:
        ◦ Use Spring Initializr to create a new Spring Boot project named LibraryManagement.
    2. Add Dependencies:
        ◦ Include dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and H2 Database.
    3. Create Application Properties:
        ◦ Configure database connection properties in application.properties.
    4. Define Entities and Repositories:
        ◦ Create Book entity and BookRepository interface.
    5. Create a REST Controller:
        ◦ Create a BookController class to handle CRUD operations.
    6. Run the Application:
        ◦ Run the Spring Boot application and test the REST endpoints.
